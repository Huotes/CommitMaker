There are no races, only countries of people Chuck Norris has beaten to different shades of black and blue.

Chuck Norris uses a night light. Not because Chuck Norris is afraid of the dark, but the dark is afraid of Chuck Norris.

There is in fact an 'I' in Norris, but there is no 'team'. Not even close.
